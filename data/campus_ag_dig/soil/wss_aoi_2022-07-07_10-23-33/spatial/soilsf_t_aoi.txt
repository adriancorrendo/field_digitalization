"KS161"|11|"DEP"|"Depression, closed"|A shallow, saucer-shaped area that is slightly lower on the landscape than the surrounding area and that does not have a natural outlet for surface drainage. Typically 1 to 5 acres.|"287052"
"KS161"|11|"ERO"|"Severely eroded spot"|An area where on the average 75 percent or more of the original surface layer has been lost because of accelerated erosion. Not used in map units that are named severely eroded, very severely eroded, or gullied. Typically 0.5 to 5 acres.|"287053"
"KS161"|11|"GPI"|"Gravel pit"|An open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed and used, without crushing, as a source of sand or gravel. Typically 1 to 5 acres.|"287054"
"KS161"|11|"LVS"|"Levee"|An embankment that confines or controls water, especially one built along the banks of a river to prevent overflow onto lowlands.|"287055"
"KS161"|11|"MPI"|"Mine or quarry"|An open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed and in which bedrock is exposed. Also denotes surface openings to underground mines. Typically 0.5 to 5 acres.|"287056"
"KS161"|11|"ROC"|"Rock outcrop"|An exposure of bedrock at the surface of the earth. Not used where the named soils of the surrounding map unit are shallow overbedrock or where Rock outcrop is a named component of the map unit. Typically 0.5 to 5 acres.|"287057"
"KS161"|11|"SAN"|"Sandy spot"|A spot where the surface layer is loamy fine sand or coarser in areas where the surface layer of the named soils in the surrounding map unit is very fine sandy loam or finer. Typically 0.5 to 5 acres.|"287058"

"KS161"|11|"WET"|"Wet spot"|A somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained area that is at least two drainage classes wetter than the named soils in the surrounding map unit. Typically 0.5 to 5 acres.|"287061"
